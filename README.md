=====

Blarg is a blog engine for Go on AppEngine. It draws inspiration from
[scanty](
http://adam.heroku.com/past/2008/11/4/scanty_the_blog_thats_almost_nothing/) and
[whisper](http://masanjin.net/whisper/). Where possible, cloud services are used
to automate away administering a blog -- Google Analytics, Disqus, Papertrail,
Librato Metrics and AdSense can be enabled by adding the appropriate auth code
to the configuration file.
