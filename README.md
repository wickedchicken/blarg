blarg
=====

Blarg is a blog engine for Go on AppEngine. It draws inspiration from
[scanty](
http://adam.heroku.com/past/2008/11/4/scanty_the_blog_thats_almost_nothing/) and
[whisper](http://masanjin.net/whisper/). Where possible, cloud services are used
to automate away administering a blog -- Google Analytics, Disqus, Papertrail,
Librato Metrics and AdSense can be enabled by adding the appropriate auth code
to the configuration file.

Blarg is still in its infancy, but is functional. Check it out!
